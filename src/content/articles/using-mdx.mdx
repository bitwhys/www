MDX combines Markdown with embedded JavaScript and JSX, making it easy to build interactive content. Below are some examples.

## Generic callouts

These are what the generic callouts look like (of course, all the text is made up):

<Callout title="Prerequisites for advanced React development" variant="note">
  This tutorial assumes you're familiar with React hooks and the component lifecycle. If you need a refresher, check out the [official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) before proceeding.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Productivity enhancement" variant="tip">
  You can quickly format your code by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (Mac).
  
  Additional shortcuts include:
  
  | Action | Windows/Linux | Mac |
  | ------ | ------------- | --- |
  | Search | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> | <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> |
  | Replace | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> | <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> |
  | Save all | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> | <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> |
</Callout>

<Callout title="Cross-browser compatibility issues" variant="warning">
  This API is **not supported** in Internet Explorer and has limited support in older browsers. Make sure to include appropriate polyfills.
  
  ```js title="polyfill.js"
  if (!Object.fromEntries) {
    Object.fromEntries = function(entries) {
      const obj = {};
      for (const [key, value] of entries) {
        obj[key] = value;
      }
      return obj;
    };
  }
  ```
  
  See the [Browser Compatibility Table](#) for detailed information.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Critical data loss risk" variant="danger">
  Running this command will **permanently delete** all files in your current directory. Make sure to back up important data before proceeding.
  
  ```bash title="danger.sh"
  # This will delete everything in the current directory
  rm -rf ./*
  # Safer alternative with confirmation
  rm -ri ./*
  ```
  
  This operation cannot be undone and recovery tools may not be able to restore your data.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Major API changes in v2.0" variant="important">
  Version 2.0 introduces significant API changes. You'll need to update your existing code to use the new parameter structure.

  1. The `configure(){:js}` method now returns a Promise
  2. Authentication requires an API key object instead of a string
  3. Event handlers use a new callback pattern
  
  A migration example looks like the following:
  ```diff lang="js"
  - app.configure("api-key-string");
  + await app.configure({ key: "api-key-string", version: "2.0" });
  
  - app.on('event', callback);
  + app.on('event', { handler: callback, options: { once: true } });
  ```
</Callout>

## Mathematical callouts

Like I mentioned before, some of these variants are meant to be nested within each other. Take, for example, the following:

<Callout title="Continuous function" variant="definition">
  A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ between topological spaces is continuous if for every open set $V \subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V) \subseteq X$ is open in $X$.
  
  <Callout title="Equivalent formulations" variant="explanation">
    For metric spaces, continuity can be characterized by: $\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0$ such that $d_X(x,y) < \delta \implies d_Y(f(x),f(y)) < \varepsilon$. This captures the intuition that points close to each other in $X$ map to points close to each other in $Y$.
  </Callout>

<Callout title="Law of Large Numbers" variant="theorem">
  Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with expected value $\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \mu < \infty$. Then for any $\varepsilon > 0$:
  $$
    \lim_{n \to \infty} P\left(\left|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i - \mu\right| > \varepsilon\right) = 0
  $$
  
  <Callout title="Proof" variant="proof">
    We'll prove this using Chebyshev's inequality. Let $S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i$ and $\sigma^2 = \text{Var}(X_i)$. By Chebyshev's inequality:
    $$
      P\left(\left|\frac{S_n}{n} - \mu\right| \geq \varepsilon\right) \leq \frac{\text{Var}(S_n/n)}{\varepsilon^2}
    $$
    
    Since the variables are independent, we have:
    $$
      \text{Var}(S_n/n) = \frac{\text{Var}(S_n)}{n^2} = \frac{n\sigma^2}{n^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
    $$
    
    Substituting this into our inequality:
    $$
      P\left(\left|\frac{S_n}{n} - \mu\right| \geq \varepsilon\right) \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{n\varepsilon^2}
    $$
    
    As $n \to \infty$, the right side approaches 0, which proves the theorem.
